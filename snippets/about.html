  <h2>About PersonaVault</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>PersonaVault</strong> is a lightweight self-discovery app designed to help you explore different sides of who you are.
    Create alternate versions of yourself, attach traits and meaningful questions to them, and gradually unlock each one through honest reflection.
  </p>

  <p>
    It’s part journal, part character sheet, part emotional mirror. There’s no AI analysis or social feed — just you and your thoughts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every persona you create is saved locally to your browser. Nothing leaves your device. You own your growth.
